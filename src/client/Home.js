                       Hi,<Waving role="img" aria-label="waving-hand">ðŸ™‹</Waving> I am Joyce Zhou. I am a senior student majoring CIT.
                       I study at Purdue University which located at West Lafayette.
                       Studying in here is a very fun experience. I wasn't a coding major,
                       in fact, I didn't thought about do computer related jobs in the future 
                       at all in my Freshman year. But then through the exploring I found out 
                       that coding is really want I like and willing to pursue as a career. 
                   </Para>
                   <Para>
                       Nothing is more logical than coding. Which I really enjoyed. For me, coding 
                       questions are as fun as those detective games. A chance working for web development
                       makes me found the more specific direction I'd love to go. When I think about that 
                       my website can be viewed by other people, it is so fun. 
                   </Para>
                   <Para>
                       Other than code, I have many other hobbies too. Like cooking, outdoor running, and 
                       reading. Those things helps me relax and keeps anxiety away from me.
